# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project, the first file is index.html where I linked my website!
on page1.html I gave brief info about my website and have a navbar to go to all the other pages.
the second page is about food items where I made a table showing my favourite food items of different cuisines.
the third page is about superheroes where I used a special background and gave some details about superheroes.
the fourth page is about the songs where I created a form to submit a song having a button. and through that, it links to other page final.html where it shows the success message
from where we can come back to the page4.html.


I used navbar to get to any page from anywhere.

Thanks,
Harsh Monga
